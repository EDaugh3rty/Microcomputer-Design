# Microcomputer-Design
Microcomputer Design is a project where a single board computer is built. 
I selected and chose all of my different components after reading many datasheets to make the computer meet the requirements.
The PCB design came next so I had to take all of my different components and put them into Kicad to design a schematic and the board itself.
The operating system written in 68K Assembly code was made to make the computer read and write to memory, read and write to the registers, and to Load and Run an S-record.
